      <p>
        Welcome to my home page! 
	      A little about me. Presently I am automotive technician for a Ford dealership. I have been working there for 3 years in June. The experience that I have gained from working at the ford dealership is non-stop. Lots of experience with electrical testing, chassis diagnostics, mechanical diagnostics and testing, and repair. I am also a full-time student at Brigham Young University-Idaho studying Automotive Engineering technology as well as minoring in Computer Programming. My hobbies are working on cars, and working with embedded computers (like Arduino). 
	      Everything I have earned/learned/or achieved in life has been from my dedication towards things that I love. I remember playing Need for Speed with my brother and loved every second of it. Little did I know that would spark a lifelong love for automobiles. Working on everything from 350 chevy blocks to my small Toyota Camry back when I was in high school. I have had a desire to learn all aspects of automobiles, and I still have an absolute passion for them and what they do. That is what brought me here now. My passion of automobiles has brought me a plethora of experience like what was listed above as well as professional experience. I quit a carpet cleaning job to work for a dealership where I started as a greeter boy and got promoted to a maintenance service advisor. There I learned a lot about leadership, communication, as well as dealer software and computer navigation. 
	      The progress does not stop there, I am currently working for another Ford dealership where I started as an apprentice technician and am now a full-on technician acquiring all sorts of experience. I have experience in all kinds of electrical testing, mechanical testing, replacing parts to repair vehicles, communication, teamwork, and all sorts of other quality experience. While working at the dealership, I am also pursuing a bachelor’s degree as well as a minor. In school I am learning things like pico-scope/oscilloscope tool use, testing and diagnostic procedures, scan tool use, as well as a deeper dive into subjects I already know. My minor is in Computer Programming where I am learning about all kinds of software development. My dedication towards things that I love has got me to this point and will not stop as my love for automobiles is growing as well as my love to learn and grow from working on them.

      <h3>Python Racing Simulator</h3>
      <p>
        With my minor in computer programming, I have had the opportunity to learn all kinds of functions and processes in order to work with Python specifically. With this project I was assigned to create a program of my choice, using the programming tools that I have learned. I chose to create a “racing simulator” since my degree is automotive engineering technology, I figured something to do with vehicles was very fitting. 
	      The racing simulator starts with a CSV (Comma, Separated, Values) which is usually data stored in a excel. The data that’s in the CSV is all the information about a select few supercars that spanned over 20 lines. Things like engine size, 0-60, top-speed, drive type, etc. are found inside this data sheet. This information is vital because that’s what is going to be used to compare the vehicles to determine the winner. The meat of the programming is using the CSV commands to pull the information from the CSV and with index commands I pulled certain information out and saved it as a variable in order to make my function design easier. Next, I created the functions in order to compare the information for each vehicle. After, I used some If/Else statements and created a huge function in order to determine the winner of each situation that I created. Finally, I created a user section where the user can pick which vehicles will race and what sections of race, they will perform in.

      <h3>Automotive Testing</h3>
      <p>
        This project is all about my automotive experience. The situation was a Hyundai Accent would crank but not start. The task was to diagnose and repair the vehicle correctly so we can return the vehicle back to the customer and give them a running vehicle. The action we had to take was figuring out that the camshaft was not spinning because the timing belt had failed. We also had to diagnose a stubborn misfire that was giving us trouble. Overall, the results were successful and we were able to fix the vehicle for the customer.
	      We achieved this diagnosis with all kinds of tools. Some important tools to note was mainly the oscilloscope that we used. WE used the oscilloscope to check timing, compression test, injector tests, coil tests, and all sorts of other voltage tests. Other tools to note, spark tester, fuel injector efficiency tester, and a multimeter. Our expertise in diagnosing and repairing vehicles was tested and overall, we learned a lot and was able to bless this gentleman and get his car back.
