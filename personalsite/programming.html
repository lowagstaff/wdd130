                    With my minor in computer programming, I have had the opportunity to learn all kinds of functions and processes in order to work with Python specifically. With this project I was assigned to create a program of my choice, using the programming tools that I have learned. I chose to create a “racing simulator” since my degree is automotive engineering technology, I figured something to do with vehicles was very fitting. 
                    The racing simulator starts with a CSV (Comma, Separated, Values) which is usually data stored in a excel. The data that’s in the CSV is all the information about a select few supercars that spanned over 20 lines. Things like engine size, 0-60, top-speed, drive type, etc. are found inside this data sheet. This information is vital because that’s what is going to be used to compare the vehicles to determine the winner. The meat of the programming is using the CSV commands to pull the information from the CSV and with index commands I pulled certain information out and saved it as a variable in order to make my function design easier. Next, I created the functions in order to compare the information for each vehicle. After, I used some If/Else statements and created a huge function in order to determine the winner of each situation that I created. Finally, I created a user section where the user can pick which vehicles will race and what sections of race, they will perform in.
