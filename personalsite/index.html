                <p>A little about me. Presently, I am an automotive technician for a local Ford dealership. I have been working there for 3 years. My hobbies are working on cars, hiking, hunting, fishing, and working with embedded computers (like Arduino). I remember playing Need for Speed with my brother and loved every second of it. Little did I know that would spark a lifelong love for automobiles. Working on everything from 350 chevy blocks to my small Toyota Camry back when I was in high school. I have had a desire to learn all aspects of automobiles, and I still have an absolute passion for them and what they do. That is what brought me here now. My passion of automobiles has brought me a plethora of experience like what was listed above as well as professional experience. My dedication towards things that I love has got me to this point and will not stop as my love for automobiles is growing as well as my love to learn and grow from working on them.</p>
