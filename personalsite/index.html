                    Welcome to my home page! 
                    A little about me. Presently I am automotive technician for a Ford dealership. I have been working there for 3 years in June. The experience that I have gained from working at the ford dealership is non-stop. Lots of experience with electrical testing, chassis diagnostics, mechanical diagnostics and testing, and repair. I am also a full-time student at Brigham Young University-Idaho studying Automotive Engineering technology as well as minoring in Computer Programming. My hobbies are working on cars, and working with embedded computers (like Arduino).

                <h2>
                    Everything I have earned/learned/or achieved in life has been from my dedication towards things that I love. I remember playing Need for Speed with my brother and loved every second of it. Little did I know that would spark a lifelong love for automobiles. Working on everything from 350 chevy blocks to my small Toyota Camry back when I was in high school. I have had a desire to learn all aspects of automobiles, and I still have an absolute passion for them and what they do. That is what brought me here now. My passion of automobiles has brought me a plethora of experience like what was listed above as well as professional experience. I quit a carpet cleaning job to work for a dealership where I started as a greeter boy and got promoted to a maintenance service advisor. There I learned a lot about leadership, communication, as well as dealer software and computer navigation. 
                    The progress does not stop there, I am currently working for another Ford dealership where I started as an apprentice technician and am now a full-on technician acquiring all sorts of experience. I have experience in all kinds of electrical testing, mechanical testing, replacing parts to repair vehicles, communication, teamwork, and all sorts of other quality experience. While working at the dealership, I am also pursuing a bachelorâ€™s degree as well as a minor. In school I am learning things like pico-scope/oscilloscope tool use, testing and diagnostic procedures, scan tool use, as well as a deeper dive into subjects I already know. My minor is in Computer Programming where I am learning about all kinds of software development. My dedication towards things that I love has got me to this point and will not stop as my love for automobiles is growing as well as my love to learn and grow from working on them.
