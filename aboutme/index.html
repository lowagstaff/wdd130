    <h2>Logan Wagstaff</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Logan Wagstaff, I am an Automotive Engineering Technology major with a minor in Computer programming. I hope to one day 
       be in charge of making the computer modules for vehicles, that is why I chose my major and minor. No matter what happens though, cars have been
       a huge part of my life and I hope that it is something that I can be a part of for my career.   
    </p>
    <p>
        As for my hobbies, as stated before, cars are a huge part of my life. I have been interested in them and/or working on them since I first played
        Need for Speed. I have even had the opportunity to be a service advisor for a Ford dealership, as well as a Ford technician currently. Some other
        hobbies I have go along the lines of being outside. I love the outdoors, hunting, fishing, camping, backpacking, shooting, just everything outside
        is such a relaxing time for me.

        Something that I am really excited to apply from this class is simply how to make a website. I have always had a dream to have my own business,
        blog, company, service, etc... and I was always wondering about how to make a great website in order to catch attention. I have also wanted to help
        others have the opportunity with a website. Also, it is just cool to learn about all the different coding and steps that involve making a website 
        which I find very fascinating. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Overall I am very excited to be a part of this class and I am excited to use these skills in the future.
